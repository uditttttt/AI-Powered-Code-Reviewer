❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){ return a+b ;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` does not declare or define the variables `a` and `b`. This will lead to an error or unexpected
behavior, as `a` and `b` are being referenced without being assigned values within the function's scope.
* ❌ The function does not accept any arguments. Without arguments, the function cannot be used to sum arbitrary numbers.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ The function now accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are used in the sum operation.
* ✔ The variables `a` and `b` are now properly defined as parameters of the function, resolving the original issue of
referencing undefined variables.
* ✔ The function can now be used to sum any two numbers passed as arguments.

Final Note:

It's crucial to define and/or pass in arguments to function, otherwise you would have error and unexpected behaviours.
